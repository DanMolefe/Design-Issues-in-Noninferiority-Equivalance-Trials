Researchers aim to obtain conclusive and reliable results in their studies. To achieve this, accurate sample size estimation is a critical methodological component. In this repository, I present a Python function—based on a paper by Hwang IK and Morikawa T. (1999)—designed to estimate sample size and power for non-inferiority or equivalence trials with either normal or binomially distributed data. By using this function, researchers can avoid selecting sample sizes that are either too large—wasting valuable resources and time—or too small, which could result in inconclusive or unreliable findings.

Following the examples showing how to apply this function, I have also included to charts:

**1. Effects of changing sample size requirement with increasing difference between groups that are being compared.**

**2. Effects of changing sample size requirement as variance increases.**
